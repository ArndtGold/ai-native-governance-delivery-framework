# Implementation Checkpoint

- Run: agdf-cockpit-mcp-app-20261005-01
- Decision: in_progress
- Current gate: CD+Tests
- Approved UR/PRD/SD/TP digests unchanged. TP approval captured against its presented revision; BFA passed.

| Task | State | Evidence / remaining work |
|---|---|---|
| T-001 | done | BROWNFIELD_ANALYSIS.md; IMPLEMENTATION_BASELINE.json |
| T-002 | minimal build verified | BUILD_DEPENDENCY_EVIDENCE.md; exact pins; final host load still unqualified |
| T-003 | minimal read path verified | CORE_READ_EVIDENCE.md; future graph/context composition pending |
| T-004 | minimal server verified | MCP_PROTOCOL_EVIDENCE.json; full approved operation semantics pending |
| T-005 | local setup verified | SETUP_ROLLBACK_EVIDENCE.json; project config readback is separate from native activation |
| T-006 | blocked by current host connection | HOST_FEASIBILITY.md; two native render calls return Transport closed |
| T-007 / T-008 | not started | Require passed early host checkpoint; graph selection and checked production packet pending |
| T-009 / T-010 | initial shared transport only | Complete UX/handoff/order/invalidation waits for T-006 |
| T-011 | partial; open finding | COMPATIBILITY_EVIDENCE.md; full current payload and compatibility still required |
| T-012 | not started | Complete host/UAT/rollback/graph knowledge closeout pending |

Implemented vertical path: shared captured-read worker/pool in Core, ephemeral strict session and schema boundary, opt-in two-tool/fixed-resource MCP mode, inline private React SDK entry, isolated canonical local assembly and named project registration. Compact entry and synthetic deliberate feasibility probes are present. They do not implement or qualify full production context handoff.

No CR/QA/UAT/OR completion, commit, push or release. Next allowed work is exact connection recovery and real-host T-006 qualification; no dependent feature expansion before it passes.

## 2026-10-06 compact entry correction

ENTRY_CARD_FIX.md records the bounded requested entry correction and embedded-only sidebar removal. Existing inventory/run reading state is reused, with explicit selection, no inferred authorization and stale recovery. T-009 compact presentation is partial; graph/complete context/handoff semantics remain pending. Native display/read path worked before refresh; post-refresh native client and context/question probes are still open. T-006 is not marked passed.

## 2026-10-06 Pages design alignment

DESIGN_ALIGNMENT.md records the user-requested common Pages design owner, local fonts, readable compact hierarchy, bound-UR run title, browser asset/CSP fix, successful builds/tests and separate browser/protocol evidence. The owned runtime is updated; the final native call returned Transport closed. T-006 and full context handoff remain unqualified; CD+Tests remains in_progress.

## 2026-10-06 decorative card header

RACE_HEADER_EVIDENCE.md records the requested subtle canonical Pages image in the compact card head, light/dark/320px layout checks and newly prepared resource. This CSS-only correction does not clear the native T-006/context/message gap. CD+Tests remains in_progress.

## 2026-10-06 visible compact card refresh

AUTO_REFRESH_EVIDENCE.md records the bounded display correction: the shared reader automatically revalidates visible compact metadata after source changes, preserves explicit selection/focus, pauses outside the viewport/hidden document and retains explicit retry on failure. Expanded/document recovery and human decisions remain unchanged. TypeScript, 16 React tests, five service tests, builds, actual synthetic browser gate transition and prepared stdio matrix passed. Native transport remains closed; T-006 and dependent full context/handoff implementation remain open.

## 2026-10-06 interactive browser preview repair

INTERACTIVE_BROWSER_EVIDENCE.md records replacement of the dead static SSR preview with the actual shared React card at /card.html using the existing authenticated local read service. Run ansehen and Zur Karte preserve explicit run/source selection; real browser interaction, 18 React tests, five service tests, TypeScript and both builds passed. Default browser entry remains full; native resource digest is unchanged. T-006 and full context/handoff remain open.

## 2026-10-06 shared branding across reading views

SHARED_BRANDING_EVIDENCE.md records one BrandHeader/style owner for card, overview, run and documents with original Pages assets, smaller/quieter document variant and intact plain reading surfaces. Existing focus regression exposed delayed effect timing; heading focus now commits before paint and background refresh still preserves focus. TypeScript, 18 React tests, five service tests, builds, actual browser/320px navigation, dark header layout and prepared protocol matrix pass. Native connection still returns Transport closed; T-006/full handoff remain open.
