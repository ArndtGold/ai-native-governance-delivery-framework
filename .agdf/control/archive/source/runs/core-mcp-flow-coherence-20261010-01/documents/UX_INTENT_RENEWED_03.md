This internal analysis proposes PRD input under approved UR scope 1-9 and AC-001..016. It is not a product specification, design, user gate, empirical usability result or implementation approval. The prepared source becomes current only through canonical recording.

- decision: ready
- blocking_reason: none for analytical PRD input; native host capability and teardown remain delivery dependencies requiring exact evidence, not confirmed working behavior
- primary_user_intent: Understand the current work/version, read and discuss it, deliberately decide once and continue from the confirmed result; retain active context when AGDF updates its own connection runtime.
- success_signal: The next action matches the canonical current state; one human decision produces one confirmed effect; a supported server replacement admits new views only after qualification while existing views and pending effects remain inspectable under their original owner. Failed replacement leaves usable prior work available or explains the real outage and owner.
- primary_decision_or_action: Read/discuss, approve, request change with comment or reject the current eligible version; inspect operation status when acknowledgement is uncertain. Runtime replacement and technical permission do not constitute a business decision.
- working_modes: current flow orientation; authoring and diagnostics; exact document and discussion; deliberate decision; pending/uncertain result; source revision; completion/history; replacement qualification; old-generation active view/drain; capacity or retirement failure; unsupported host UI; closed/expired view

## Effective and visible states

| Working mode / effective state | Visible meaning and primary presentation | User action / recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Current flow orientation | Current work, effective gate, evidence and the allowed next operation; saved summary and historical receipt are separately identified | Continue the stated operation or inspect its owner/blocker |
| Draft or invalid authoring | Exact current draft and bound check findings, including source/field/form correction | Correct the draft, recheck and prepare a new current presentation; failed checks never imply approval |
| Decision-ready version | Concise complete summary, changes/open points, exact version and consequence | Read exact large document and return; discuss; one deliberate approve/change/reject action |
| Discussion | Reading, questions, AI replies and quoted Approval text are not decisions | Later exact Approval formula may decide only the still-current eligible presentation; changed material needs fresh presentation/response |
| Change/rejection | Saved change request with comment or rejection concerns this exact version and grants no replacement approval | Follow the existing permitted draft/revision owner; empty required comment yields correction before dispatch |
| Pending decision | Submission is processing, not saved success; repeated local actions are unavailable | Wait or inspect the original operation; close/navigation does not replay the write |
| Technical permission | The host may ask permission to execute the bound tool; this remains separate from gate approval | Grant/deny technical execution deliberately; denial is not saved business success |
| Unknown acknowledgement | A write may have happened; its effect is uncertain | Inspect original UUID/receipt and current applicability; use only the supported same-operation recovery, never create another approval to resolve uncertainty |
| Source revision | Preview shows affected versions/approvals before exact application; old evidence is historical afterward | Review exact impact, apply only authorized current proposal, obtain new decisions for changed sources |
| Completion/history | Valid governance completion is distinct from missing/blocked current obligations and historical insufficient records | Inspect history; no Git/publication action or fabricated migration of old evidence |
| Qualifying replacement | Previous usable generation remains current until startup, identities and required actual host capability have passed | Existing work continues; failure explains why switch was refused and which owner can correct it |
| Switched, old generation still active | New views use the qualified current generation; old view/document/pending decision remains with its original owner/version | Continue existing context; no request to resubmit a decision merely because runtime changed |
| Retiring eligible old generation | Only an own, safely idle generation is being closed; age alone does not make it eligible | No destructive choice involving foreign/active work; confirmed exit frees capacity |
| Capacity full or retirement failed | Further switch is refused because all slots remain active/uncertain or termination is unconfirmed | Explain retained work and actionable owner/recheck; a failed close still occupies capacity, not an apparent successful cleanup |
| Missing host UI support | This connection has not supplied required UI capability; card/native support is unavailable | Show exact support limit and external host owner; keep supported text/inspection route without presenting it as native qualification |
| Closed or expired view | The view cannot decide; original saved/uncertain effect remains separately inspectable | Obtain a fresh eligible view as supported; no resurrected authority or automatic replay |

- effective_state_by_mode: The table distinguishes business state, operation effect, presentation eligibility, runtime admission and view lifetime. They cannot be collapsed into one 'ready' or 'approved' label.
- visible_state_types: current; draft/check findings; decision-ready; pending; saved approved/change/rejected; uncertain; conflicting/stale/historical; completing/completed/blocked; qualifying/current/draining/closing/close-unconfirmed; capacity-refused; host-ui-unavailable; view-expired/closed
- effective_state_authority_by_mode: Core current state and existing writers/receipts own business eligibility/effect; the actual connection's lifecycle owner owns its runtime admission/retirement facts; the host owns declared UI capability and native teardown facts. The model, age/PID, card renderer and technical permission cannot independently confer these states.
- primary_state_presentation_owner_by_mode: Flow/cockpit orientation shows the current business state; the bound decision interaction shows exact version and pending/effect status; runtime recovery feedback explains replacement/capacity/host support; the text path expresses the same still-current eligible human decision. These are user-facing roles, not component/endpoint prescriptions.

## Activation, blockers and recovery

- activation_paths: Explicit supported bound operations use the existing target/Run/revision contract. Read/document/discussion does not activate approval. A replacement affects only the already-owned connection and new views after successful qualification. No implicit foreign-server selection, business approval, source revision or global restart is introduced.
- deactivation_paths: Superseded/expired material disables decision eligibility; closing/expiry retires the view through supported cleanup; runtime retirement requires safe idle state and confirmed end. In-flight or uncertain effects keep original operation identity even after view closure.
- blockers: invalid, stale or foreign binding; missing required comment; missing or unqualified actual UI support; mismatching runtime/resource identity; all own slots active/uncertain; failed/unconfirmed close; unresolved business acknowledgement; changed material or missing review/QA evidence.
- recovery_paths: Bound correction/recheck for authoring; prepare current material for stale view; original-operation inspection for uncertainty; supported exact preview/apply for source changes; keep usable prior generation after failed qualification; visible retry/recheck after transient runtime failure, while preserving active capacity; external host action when UI/teardown is unsupported. No retry instruction may resubmit a business decision under a new UUID.
- relevant_state_transitions: current -> exact read -> return/discussion -> deliberate click or equal text -> pending -> confirmed effect/current next operation; changed source -> preview/apply -> archived evidence -> new eligible decisions; qualification -> verified current generation -> old active/draining -> eligible idle -> close -> confirmed freed slot; failed qualification -> retained prior current; capacity/close failure -> visible refusal/recovery; native unsupported -> explicit dependency until fresh actual evidence.

## Proposed PRD acceptance input

- proposed_prd_acceptance_criteria: Fix the supported positive, malformed, stale, concurrency, unknown-effect and completed/history cases before implementation. Verify one cross-route decision, exact read/return, meaningful focus and no Enter-in-comment approval in all registered languages. Verify replacement qualification before admission, active/foreign protection, one current switch under concurrency, truthful capacity/refusal/close outcome and original-UUID recovery. Qualify native capability/render/interaction/teardown separately at the actual candidate. Use fixed before/after scenarios to measure unnecessary search/manual/schema/follow-up/recovery overhead without weakening decisions.
- open_product_questions: None prevents analytical drafting under the approved need. PRD must choose explicit finite capacity/drain/expiry and user-facing recovery promises within UR safeguards, supported versus dependency-blocked situations and measurable scenario boundaries. SD decides implementation/routing/compatibility. No value, endpoint, general supervisor or hidden host guarantee is prescribed here.
- affected_outputs: current flow/contract guidance; draft findings; bound card/text decision; document/history/evidence presentation; replacement/capacity/close feedback; native support diagnostics; qualification reports
- evidence: Approved UR AC-001..016; BROWNFIELD_REVIEW_RENEWED_03.md; EVIDENCE_BROWNFIELD_RENEWED_03.md; current launcher/server/decision-session owners; NATIVE_CONNECTION_FINDING_01.md; matched productive reconnection and successful contract retry
- missing_evidence: No missing user intent prevents PRD drafting. The exact native loss point, safe replacement implementation, actual new-candidate usability, full flow comparison and benefit measurements are missing delivery evidence and remain explicit later prerequisites.
- required_next_step: Record the renewed analytical route and this result via canonical writers; then draft renewed PRD through its existing owner. Existing dependent approvals/fulfillment remain invalidated.
