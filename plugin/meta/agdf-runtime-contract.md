# AGDF Runtime Contract

This contract centralizes recurring runtime rules for AGDF skills.
It is the operational reference for skill outputs, but it is not a second copy of the framework documentation.

## Mode Selection

| Mode | Default | Escalate When |
|---|---|---|
| Quick Task Mode | small questions, reviews, debugging, local fixes without new product semantics | a new user capability, architecture/policy/persistence impact, formal artefacts, or approvals are involved |
| Structured Delivery Mode | formal delivery runs, gate-relevant work, release-critical changes | always use gate discipline, internal reviews, and OR |

Quick Task Mode must not become ritual gate overhead.
Structured Delivery must not bypass missing approvals.

## Gate Rules

- User gates: `UR -> PRD -> SD -> TP -> QA -> UAT`
- Internal mandatory steps: `Brownfield Analysis -> CD+Tests -> CR -> OR`
- Exact approval formula: `Approval: <GateName>`
- Legacy alias: `Freigabe: <GateName>` may be accepted when reviewing older German runs, but all new outputs must use `Approval: <GateName>`.
- Implicit consent is not approval.
- The earliest blocking gate wins.
- `CD+Tests` is implementation and test status only, not a delivery signal.
- `agdf-code-review` standardizes the mandatory `CR` step, but does not replace QA.
- `agdf-qa-gate` decides final `pass | revise | block`.
- `agdf-release-or` reports the run, but does not replace QA.

## Quality Contract Output

Structured Delivery skills use this shape when relevant:

- `decision`: `pass | revise | block | not_applicable`
- `evidence`: concrete artefacts, files, tests, logs, diffs, or observations
- `missing_evidence`: missing proof needed for a stronger claim
- `risks`: remaining risks, assumptions, fallbacks, drift, or blockers
- `required_next_step`: exactly the next clean step
- `impact_codes`: affected Quality Contract codes, if the target repo has a registry

A skill may briefly remind this shape, but must not duplicate a complete code or rule matrix.

## Context Graph Output

When a run affects project memory or a Context Graph, use:

- `Situation:` short plain-language summary when the impact is non-trivial
- `context_graph_impact`: `none | link_only | update_existing_node | new_node_required | sot_drift`
- `context_graph_refs`
- `context_graph_required_action`: `none | link | update | create | resolve_drift`
- `context_graph_gate_effect`: `none | warning | revise | block`
- `context_graph_evidence`

Do not create a new node for a mere version, a general chat summary, or a local observation without a concrete next clean step.
`sot_drift` must not pass silently as a warning.

## Skill Output

Every skill output should be as short as possible and as concrete as needed.
It must distinguish:

- facts
- evidence
- assumptions
- interpretations
- missing evidence
- the next permissible step

## Do Not Duplicate

The explanatory framework lives in `docs/`.
The operating philosophy lives in `plugin/meta/agdf-constitution.md`.
The principles live in `plugin/meta/agdf-tenets.md`.
This contract is only the compact runtime interface for skills.
