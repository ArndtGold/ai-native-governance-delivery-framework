description: "Use this skill for this scope: after gate-check permits Brownfield Review or implementation preparation, before non-trivial changes in existing systems. Boundary: clarifies reuse, owners, risks and Mode/Slice Decision; never bypasses gate-check; Brownfield Review is not implementation permission. Automatic discovery alone does not activate AGDF."

# brownfield-analysis

## Purpose
Ensure delivery in an existing system is Brownfield-oriented, not Greenfield-style.

The skill answers:

- which existing artefacts matter
- what already exists fully or partially
- what can be reused, extended, or refactored
- whether new artefacts are really needed
- architecture, compatibility, migration, and regression impact
- the minimal clean next step
- whether Context Graph impact exists without automatically creating a node

## Runtime Contract
After `skill_continuation`, use these focused runtime-contract modules:

- `../../meta/contracts/gate-transition.md`
- `../../meta/contracts/modes.md`
- `../../meta/contracts/context-graph.md`
- `../../meta/contracts/quality.md`

`instruction_only`: first load `../../meta/contracts/task-target-resolution.md` and `../../meta/contracts/interaction.md`.

<!-- AGDF-REQUEST-ACTIVATION-GUARD:START -->
## Request Activation

- `owner`: `request_activation_contract`
- `path`: `plugin/meta/contracts/request-activation.md`
- `policy_version`: `1`
- `guard_fingerprint`: `sha256:50833bf7396f65e57ffd73bb9200e6dfd5dc016440e6d7186fbcd8a6e07dd2ab`

Decide effect from loaded instructions before AGDF action/output.

Abstain silently, call no AGDF owner, for assessment/explanation/comparison/recommendation/review/diagnosis/advice; hypothetical/example/error/code/quoted/negated delivery language; AGDF as subject; or a read-only constraint absent other delivery. Ambiguity is read-only: answer or ask one neutral question.

Activate only for actual delivery/mutation, binding gate artefact, explicit AGDF/control-lifecycle operation or unambiguous active-run action; delivery wins mixed intent.

Invocation proof: explicit user text/trusted ephemeral action, not discovery/selection, skill load, hooks, cwd, repo/control or prior runs.

Then choose one catalog route. Non-authorizing; downstream checks remain.

## Executable Dispatch

First invoke the supplied dispatcher with `--skill brownfield-analysis`, current language and working
directory, and only explicit target/run evidence. On `terminal: true`, return presentation verbatim;
only if absent return recovery, then stop. On `skill_continuation`, use only its target/control. If unavailable, report
`dispatcher_unavailable` and do not search for another runtime. Dispatch never authorizes.

Brownfield-specific output must make evidence, missing existing-system view, parallel-structure risk, reuse strategy, and the minimal next step visible.
When `.agdf/control/` is present, persist or link `post_ur_review` output under `.agdf/control/artefacts/<key>/BROWNFIELD_REVIEW.md`.

## Modes

- `post_ur_review`: use after approved durable UR to size and route the work. Output must decide `quick_task`, `verified_change`, `structured_slice`, `structured_delivery`, or `block` with scope reason and evidence.
- `pre_implementation_analysis`: use after approved durable TP to verify the implementation path before `CD+Tests`. Output must focus on reuse path, owners, regression risk, test impact and minimal clean implementation.

Do not mix both modes silently. Name the active mode in the output.

In `post_ur_review`, also record `delivery_context`, `ui_ux_impact`, `ui_ux_impact_reason` and
`ux_intent_definition_required` using the single classification and routing contract in
`../../meta/contracts/gate-transition.md`. Greenfield records make existing-system evidence explicitly
not applicable; Brownfield records cite repository evidence. Do not create a second Greenfield router.

## Rules
1. Brownfield first: understand the existing codebase before PRD/SD decisions when existing-system impact is possible, and again before implementation.
2. Brownfield Review after `Approval: UR` is a sizing and routing step. It must visibly decide `quick_task`, `verified_change`, `structured_slice`, `structured_delivery`, or `block` before PRD depth or implementation is chosen. Persist the completed review and its decision, scope reason, evidence and required next gate in the same internal operation; mark the review `done` only after both the artefact and canonical run projection are complete. An interrupted, incomplete or legacy record stays at fail-closed `Mode/Slice Decision` recovery without another user approval.
3. Reuse-before-create: prefer existing modules, services, components, tables, endpoints, tests, and configuration.
4. Minimal clean slice: choose the smallest durable intervention, not merely the smallest technical diff.
5. No silent parallel structures.
6. Existing architecture, naming, error handling, logging, security, and test conventions are binding unless deviation is justified.
7. What is not visibly evidenced does not count as existing.
8. Async execute paths must not become a second product-policy decision point.
9. Visible state ownership must be checked for chat, rendering, scrolling, recovery, and status problems.
10. SoT/runtime/product-semantics drift must be named; if official behaviour must be decided first, recommend UR or equivalent product direction.
11. Large UI surfaces and state hooks must be checked for mixed render, view-model, derived state, orchestration, persistence, and recovery ownership.
12. Context Graph impact must be curated; it is not a review log or version index.
13. Specification archive migrations must follow the archive index if present.
14. In `post_ur_review`, evaluate unchanged compact paths first. For a structured candidate, apply
    only the `Structured Depth Decision` in `modes.md`; do not recreate its trigger/check matrix in
    this skill.
15. A positive structured decision requires `depth_policy_version: 1`,
    `depth_facts_status: complete`, complete evidence for all seven bounded-slice checks, a primary
    reason code, rejected alternative and evidence references. A decisive full-depth trigger may
    support `structured_delivery`; `structured_slice` requires every bounded-slice check to pass.
16. Missing or conflicting decisive facts without an already-evidenced full-depth trigger persist
    the existing `block` decision with `depth_facts_missing | depth_facts_conflicting`, named facts,
    their evidence owner where known, a Brownfield Review link and a precise next action for evidence
    completion and Brownfield/Mode-Slice re-evaluation.
17. Owner, file, consumer, task or derived-path counts must never select a structured depth by
    themselves.

## When To Use
- after `gate-check` permits `Brownfield Review` or the selected canonical run record names Brownfield Review as the next allowed action
- after `gate-check` permits implementation preparation or the selected canonical run record already names Brownfield Analysis as the next allowed action
- after `Approval: UR` when existing owners, SoT, contracts, policies, persistence, runtime paths, tests, UI, UX or architecture may affect PRD/SD scope
- before `CD+Tests`
- before changes to an existing repository
- bug fixes in existing modules
- feature extensions in existing architecture
- refactorings
- unclear existing coverage
- risk of new parallel structures
- a TP is clear but its connection to the existing system is not

## Inputs
Use what is available:

- approved UR, Task Plan, `task_id`, `story_id`
- project structure
- affected files, modules, services, APIs, data models
- existing tests
- architecture notes from PRD or SD
- repository conventions

If inputs are missing, work only from observable evidence and mark gaps explicitly.
If gate status, approval, scope or next allowed action is unclear, stop and route to `gate-check` instead of recommending PRD/SD detail or starting implementation.
When used as Brownfield Review after `Approval: UR`, do not recommend PRD, SD, TP, or implementation until the Mode/Slice Decision is explicit, evidenced and recorded.

## Workflow
1. Identify affected tasks and scope.
2. Find relevant existing artefacts.
3. Assess current coverage before new implementation:
   - `fully_done`
   - `partially_done`
   - `not_done`
4. Choose reuse strategy:
   - `extend`
   - `refactor`
   - `replace`
   - `new`
5. Assess change impact:
   - files/modules
   - interfaces
   - data model/migrations
   - backwards compatibility
   - regression tests
   - side effects
6. Check parallel-structure risk.
7. Check SoT/runtime/product-semantics drift.
8. Check primary visible ownership for UI/status/recovery paths.
9. Check UI monolith risk for large surfaces or central hooks.
10. Check Context Graph impact according to `../../meta/contracts/context-graph.md`.
11. Recommend the minimal clean implementation path.
12. In `post_ur_review`, record `depth_policy_version`, `depth_facts_status`,
    `primary_reason_code`, `decisive_full_depth_triggers`, `rejected_alternative`,
    `missing_or_conflicting_facts`, `depth_evidence_refs` and evidence for all seven bounded-slice
    check IDs in the Brownfield Review. Then persist the completed review and the existing
    Mode/Slice Decision atomically.

## Output
Use a concise structure:

```text
## Brownfield Analysis
- mode: post_ur_review | pre_implementation_analysis
- decision: pass | revise | block | not_applicable
- mode_slice_decision: quick_task | verified_change | structured_slice | structured_delivery | block
- required_next_gate: none | PRD | SD | TP | Brownfield Analysis
- artefact: .agdf/control/artefacts/<key>/BROWNFIELD_REVIEW.md | none
- scope:
- evidence:
- transparency: why later artefacts are skipped, shortened or required
- missing_evidence:
- current_coverage:
- reuse_strategy:
- risks:
- context_graph_impact:
- required_next_step:
```

For `post_ur_review`, include the four UI/UX routing fields immediately after `scope`. If UX intent
definition is required, its `ready | blocked | not_applicable` result must be visible before PRD
readiness. A required `blocked` result is at least `revise` for this routing step.

For a structured `post_ur_review` candidate, also include the complete `Structured Depth Evidence`
section from `BROWNFIELD_REVIEW.md`. The decision projection must show the primary reason, decisive
dimensions, bounded-slice result, rejected alternative, evidence and required next gate. For
missing/conflicting facts, show product-language `depth_unresolved` while persisting `block`; name
the gap and exact recovery action. Structural instruction checks can detect missing contract
elements but do not prove semantic model compliance or live-host behavior.

## Pass / Revise / Block Guidance
- `pass`: existing owners are understood, reuse path is clear, and no blocking drift or parallel structure risk remains.
- `revise`: relevant evidence, tests, ownership, or reuse path is incomplete.
- `block`: implementation would create a second SoT, second owner, unresolved product semantics, or hard unmitigated risk.

## Forbidden
This skill must not:

- propose a Greenfield replacement without evidence
- silently accept overlapping ownership
- convert product-semantics drift into a mere refactor
- create Context Graph nodes automatically
- treat archive links as active current specification signals
- recommend broad PRD/SD/TP or implementation by reflex before Mode/Slice Decision is recorded
