# ur-definition

## Runtime Contract

Use the returned `continuation.runtime_contracts` after `skill_continuation`. If absent, load
`../../meta/contracts/ur-definition.md` through the supplied contract reader or bundled file.
Missing contract or invalid binding: stop. This skill owns UR content; gate-check owns readiness.

`instruction_only`: first load `../../meta/contracts/task-target-resolution.md` and `../../meta/contracts/interaction.md`.

<!-- AGDF-REQUEST-ACTIVATION-GUARD:START -->
## Request Activation

- `owner`: `request_activation_contract`
- `path`: `meta/contracts/request-activation.md`
- `policy_version`: `1`
- `guard_fingerprint`: `sha256:af2f01f9e18a3ba1c520faf0691aa1cd4a4299bdfa027cf83651c5d14319bfdc`

Decide effect from loaded instructions before AGDF action.

Abstain silently (no AGDF call) for assessment/explanation/comparison/recommendation/review/diagnosis/advice; hypothetical/example/error/code/quoted/negated delivery language; AGDF as subject; or a read-only constraint absent other delivery. Ambiguity is read-only: answer or ask one neutral question.

Activate for any requested file/code change however small, a binding gate artefact, explicit AGDF/control-lifecycle operation or unambiguous active-run action; delivery wins mixed intent.

Invocation proof: explicit user text/trusted ephemeral action, not discovery/selection, skill load, hooks, cwd, repo/control or prior runs.

Then pick one catalog route; non-authorizing, downstream checks remain.

## Executable Dispatch

Use listed MCP `agdf_dispatch` (load deferred; host prefix allowed): `skill_id` `ur-definition`, `presentation_language`, `working_directory`, and only bound `target_source`/`primary_target` and `run_id`. Never search unlisted tools.
If absent/failing: supplied schema-2 executable, child-only environment, immutable argv_prefix, declared arguments; `--skill ur-definition`, language and working directory.
For `--language`: Required presentation language for the latest natural-language user request as one well-formed BCP 47 tag. If the request explicitly asks for a response language, use that tag; otherwise use the dominant request language. Use en when mixed or ambiguous. A valid unsupported tag renders through the complete English pack. Missing or invalid input fails before governance evaluation.
`target_source`: `explicit_target` if request names `primary_target`; `continued_target` if it unambiguously continues confirmed target; `current_repository` if request names this/current repo with one matching repo active. Otherwise omit the pair; cwd has no target authority.
Quote shell values as data.
For a result with `terminal: true`, the entire assistant response must consist only of host_action.text, copied verbatim. Add no question, explanation, heading, citation, link or other surrounding text; do not translate or reformat it; invoke no later tool and stop.
On skill_continuation use only its target/control. Without that tool and a valid binding: `dispatcher_unavailable`; no runtime search, environment repair
or help retries. Dispatch never authorizes.

## Workflow

Follow the focused UR contract using the original request and answered conversation context.
Write only the supplied unapproved UR, preserving uncertainty and explicit human approval.
After canonical recording, redispatch gate-check; use its fresh presentation and wait.
